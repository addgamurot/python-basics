'''week_temps_f is a string with a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by the , sign. 
Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the average (sum divided by number of items) and assigns it to avg_temp. 
Do not hard code your answer (i.e., make your code compute both the sum or the number of items in week_temps_f) 
(You should use the .split(",") function to split by "," and float() to cast to a float).'''


week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"
sum_temp = 0
temps_f = week_temps_f.split(',')
print(temps_f)
for temps in temps_f:
    print(temps)
    sum_temp += float(temps)
print(sum_temp)
avg_temp = sum_temp/len(temps_f)
print(avg_temp)
